python script.py
```

#### Live Trading Mode
```bash
# Edit script.py to set:
# - SIMULATION_MODE = False
# - EXECUTION_MODE = True
# - Add your PRIVATE_KEY to .env
python script.py
```

### Execution Modes

1. **Simulation Mode**: 
   - No real transactions sent
   - Safe for testing and learning
   - Shows what trades would be executed

2. **Live Mode**:
   - Real transactions on Base network
   - Requires funded wallet
   - Uses safe position sizes ($5 default)

## Safety Features

## Flash Loan Arbitrage Flow

### üîÑ **Complete Flash Loan Execution Flow**

The bot now supports flash loan arbitrage for enhanced capital efficiency. Here's how the full flow works:

#### **1. Opportunity Detection & Analysis**
```
üìä Scanning DEXes ‚Üí üîç Finding price differences ‚Üí üìà Calculating flash loan vs regular profit
```

#### **2. Strategy Selection**
- **Regular Arbitrage**: Uses your own capital (current $5 position size)
- **Flash Loan Arbitrage**: Borrows large amounts ($100k) for maximum profit

#### **3. Flash Loan Execution Flow**

**Step 1: Flash Loan Request**
```python
# Borrow $100k worth of tokens from Aave
flash_loan_amount = 100000  # USD
flash_loan_token = WETH_BASE  # Most liquid token
flash_loan_function = aave_lending_pool.borrow(
    flash_loan_token,
    flash_loan_amount_wei,
    2,  # Variable interest rate
    0,  # Referral code
    wallet_address
)
```

**Step 2: Arbitrage Execution**
```python
# Execute arbitrage with borrowed funds
1. Approve borrowed tokens for buy DEX
2. Buy token on cheaper DEX (e.g., Uniswap)
3. Approve received tokens for sell DEX  
4. Sell token on expensive DEX (e.g., SushiSwap)
5. Receive profit + original borrowed amount
```

**Step 3: Flash Loan Repayment**
```python
# Repay flash loan with fees
flash_loan_fee = 0.09%  # Aave flash loan fee
total_repay = borrowed_amount + flash_loan_fee
repay_function = aave_lending_pool.repay(
    flash_loan_token,
    total_repay_amount,
    2,  # Variable interest rate
    wallet_address
)
```

#### **4. Profit Calculation**

**Regular Arbitrage (Current):**
- Position Size: $5
- Profit: ~$0.25 (5% of $5)
- Capital Required: $5

**Flash Loan Arbitrage (Enhanced):**
- Position Size: $100,000
- Profit: ~$500 (0.5% of $100k)
- Capital Required: $0 (borrowed)
- Flash Loan Fee: $90 (0.09%)
- Net Profit: $410

#### **5. Safety & Risk Management**

**Flash Loan Safety Features:**
- **Minimum Profit Threshold**: $50 minimum profit to use flash loans
- **Maximum Position Size**: $100k flash loan limit
- **Fee Calculation**: 0.09% Aave flash loan fee
- **Gas Optimization**: Base network low gas costs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure recovery

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Atomic Transactions**: All operations in single transaction
- **Slippage Protection**: 1% maximum slippage
- **Liquidity Checks**: Minimum $100k pool liquidity
- **Token Validation**: Only major tokens (WETH, USDC)

#### **6. Execution Modes**

**Safe Mode (Current):**
```python
SAFE_MODE = True
FLASH_LOAN_ENABLED = False  # Disabled for safety
# Uses regular arbitrage with $5 positions
```

**Flash Loan Mode (Advanced):**
```python
SAFE_MODE = False
FLASH_LOAN_ENABLED = True
# Uses flash loans for $100k positions
```

#### **7. Real-World Example**

**Scenario**: WETH/weETH arbitrage opportunity
```
üìä Price Difference Detected:
   Uniswap: 1.000123 WETH/weETH
   SushiSwap: 1.000456 WETH/weETH
   Profit: 0.33%

üöÄ Flash Loan Execution:
   1. Borrow 40 WETH ($100k) from Aave
   2. Buy 40 weETH on Uniswap @ 1.000123
   3. Sell 40 weETH on SushiSwap @ 1.000456
   4. Receive 40.133 WETH (profit: 0.133 WETH)
   5. Repay 40 WETH + 0.036 WETH fee to Aave
   6. Keep 0.097 WETH profit (~$242)

üí∞ Net Result:
   Gross Profit: $330
   Flash Loan Fee: $90
   Gas Costs: $2
   Net Profit: $238
```

#### **8. Technical Implementation**

**Flash Loan Contract Integration:**
```python
# Aave V3 Lending Pool (Base Network)
AAVE_LENDING_POOL = "0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5"

# Flash Loan Settings
FLASH_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD = 100000  # $100k
FLASH_LOAN_FEE_PCT = 0.0009     # 0.09%
FLASH_LOAN_MIN_PROFIT_USD = 50  # $50 minimum
```

**Execution Methods:**
- `execute_flash_loan_arbitrage()`: Main flash loan execution
- `execute_flash_loan_operation()`: Flash loan request and repayment
- `execute_arbitrage_with_flash_loan()`: Arbitrage with borrowed funds
- `repay_flash_loan()`: Flash loan repayment with fees

#### **9. Monitoring & Logging**

**Flash Loan Execution Logs:**
```

- **Larger Positions**: $100k vs $5 positions
- **Higher Profits**: Scale with borrowed amount

**Risk Management:**
- **Atomic Execution**: All operations in single transaction
- **No Liquidation Risk**: Flash loans are repaid immediately
- **Predictable Costs**: Fixed flash loan fees

**Profit Optimization:**
- **MEV Protection**: Flash loans are harder to front-run
- **Gas Efficiency**: Single transaction vs multiple
- **Slippage Reduction**: Larger orders can get better prices
